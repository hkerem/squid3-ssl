basic_radius_auth V1.09

This kit is loosely based on radtest from the Cistron-radiusd which
again is based on Livingston sources. See COPYRIGHT for details.

This authenticator is specifically made for Squid-2.5 and later.

Installation:

Copy the correct makefile to Makefile
   Makefile.default = Most OS:es.
   Makefile.solaris = SunOS5 (Solaris)

cp Makefile.default Makefile   
make clean
make install

or if you want the helper installed elsewhere than /usr/local/squid
(the default installation path of Squid) use something like:

make CONFDIR=/etc PREFIX=/usr BINDIR='${PREFIX}/libexec/squid' install

Complete list of make options for tweakin the installation paths:

  PREFIX   Top level installation directory (/usr/local/squid)
  BINDIR   Where the binary is installed (PREFIX/libexec)
  CONFDIR  Where the configuration file is installed (PREFIX/etc)
  MANDIR   Where the manpage is installed (PREFIX/man/man8)
  MANEXT   Manpage extension (.8)
  DESTDIR  Root prefix for packaging


Configuration:

The RADIUS authenticator is configured using a small configuration file.

The configuration file should look like this:
# basic_radius_auth configuration file
# MvS: 28-10-1998
server suncone.cistron.nl
secret testje

An example can be found in etc/basic_radius_auth.conf 


/etc/services:

Modify /etc/services and add:
radius          1812/udp

Adding this is not mandatory because it used the default port 1812 anyway.

Note: Some old RADIUS servers uses the unofficial port 1645, and you may
need to override the service port used either by editing /etc/services
or by specifying the port using the -p command line option or the port
tag in basic_radius_auth.conf


Test it:

Start basic_radius_auth and type a username and a username. The authenticator
returns OK if the radiusd accepted your password. In any other case you'll
get ERR.


Squid:

Add the authenticator to squid.conf. See the instructions from squid for
help.
