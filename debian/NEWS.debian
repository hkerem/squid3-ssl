squid3 (3.0.STABLE15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 3.0.STABLE15-1 error pages are not included in squid3-common
  anymore, but are instead shipped in a separate package (squid-langpack).

  If the error_directory option in /etc/squid3/squid.conf was customized, it
  should be checked against the new directory layout of squid-langpack; if
  it is not set correctly, squid3 will refuse to start.
